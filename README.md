This is a Personal Dashboard project created as a Chrome Extension. 
In creating this project, I have made use of Unsplash API, CoinGecko API and OpenWeather API. 
Modern JavaScript is used to fetch and filter data from the API.
The API, which I accessed through JavaScript's fetch function, returns JSON data on the background images 
from Unsplash, Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko and the current temperature from Open Weather.
In order to incorporate all these features on the web page, I have used Flex-box to design the layout.
